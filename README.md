# âž¤ python-codes
This is a collection of various python scripts I wrote in past while self learning python. The files are constantly added, and in somewhat random fashion. Over the time I will try to organize them into folders. For most exercises, you will need to have `numpy` installed.

| `pip install numpy` |or | `conda install numpy` |
|-------------------  |-  |---------------------  |

At the moment there are following folder for categorised exercises.

- [anim](anim/)
- [lattice](lattice/)
- [myqlm](myqlm/)
- [pulser](pulser/)
- [qiskit](qiskit/)
- [visualize_nn](visualize_nn/)

More updates soon!
